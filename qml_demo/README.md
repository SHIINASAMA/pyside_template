# QML Demo

> [!WARNING]  
> This directory is for demonstration purposes only and is
> not intended to be directly integrated into the workflow of the current project.  
> Its structure, configuration, 
> and build process are designed solely to showcase a minimal runnable QML example, 
> rather than a production-grade solution.  
> As such, it may not even build successfully (though this may improve in the future).  
> In short, you should not use its contents directly in real project work.

For testing only, you can run it from source using:

```bash
uv run pyside-cli -t QmlDemo --rc
uv run QmlDemo
```
