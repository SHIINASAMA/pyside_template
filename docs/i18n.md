# Internationalization

It is generally recommended to perform internationalization after the main functionality is essentially complete. This
helps avoid modifying translation files multiple times.

Add the i18n configuration in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.build.i18n]
languages = [
    "zh_CN"
]
```

Use the command line to automatically collect translatable strings:

```bash
uv run -m tool --i18n
```

This will generate `.ts` files under the `app/i18n/` directory, such as `zh_CN.ts`. You can then translate the text
according to the `.ts` file format.

For multi-language switching logic, refer to the `i18n` section in `app/__main__.py`.
